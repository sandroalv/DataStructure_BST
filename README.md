# Data Structures Project: Binary Search Tree Operations
This project encapsulates a detailed exploration and implementation of various operations on Binary Search Trees (BSTs). A BST is a fundamental data structure in computer science that enables efficient data management and retrieval. The Jupyter Notebook titled 'Alvines_BST_individual_assignment' is a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing BST operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

**Key Concepts Covered:**

Delete Node Method: An algorithm to remove nodes from a BST while maintaining its properties.
Get Predecessor Method: A technique to find the in-order predecessor of a given node in the BST.
Traverse Method: Strategies to traverse the BST and process nodes in a specific order (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).
The project is designed for educational purposes, providing insights into the mechanics of tree operations and their use cases in software development. It serves as an essential resource for students and developers looking to deepen their understanding of algorithmic principles and data structure manipulation.
